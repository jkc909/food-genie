# Food Genie

### What is it?

Food Genie scrapes products on sale from local grocery stores and suggests recipes based on ingredients that are on sale. 

Food Genie is also a weekly meal planning app to help manage and automate nourishment decisions. 

Built with Rails, React and Python. 

*in early development*

### What does it do?

Users have a pool of recipes, and they can drag and drop recipes into a weekly meal planner. The app tracks daily calories, spending, and time spent cooking. In addition to tracking these metrics, the app will also generate a shopping list for the week. 

Recipes are populated by third-party APIs, web scrapers, and user input.

### Why?

Personal enrichment. Also, this has a practical use in my daily life.
